# Cyberbullying Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying in online social networks using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes user-generated text data to classify and flag harmful or abusive content, helping to create safer digital environments.

Features
- Preprocessing of social media text data
- Deep learning-based text classification using LSTM/GRU/BERT models
- Detection of various types of cyberbullying (e.g., insults, threats, racism)
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK / spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cyberbullying-detection.git](https://github.com/your-username/cyberbullying-detection.git)

2. Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the training script:

python train\_model.py

Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available datasets such as the [Kaggle Cyberbullying Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

 Future Improvements
- Integration with social media platforms for real-time monitoring
- Multilingual support
- Enhanced model accuracy using ensemble methods
